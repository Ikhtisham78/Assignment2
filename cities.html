                        elevation of over 7,300 feet (2,225 meters) in Pakistan's northern Gilgit-Baltistan region.

                        The beauty of the valley is enhanced by its fresh spring water, delicious fruits, the blue water
                        of the Indus River, historical sites, lakes, and pleasant weather, which attract tourists from
                        around the world.

                        The city of Skardu is the main urban center and headquarters of the Skardu district, a strategic
                        northern region of Pakistan bordering China, Afghanistan, and India.

                        The valley is known as a major tourism and trekking hub, and a gateway to four peaks towering
                        over 8,000 meters high, attracting tourists, mountaineers, and trekkers from abroad..</p>
