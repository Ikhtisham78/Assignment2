                    <p class="card-text">Imran Khan did not win a landslide victory in Pakistan's general election in
                        July 2018, as his party failed to obtain the simple majority required to establish his own
                        government without forming an agreement with other political parties. Because there is a
                        widespread belief that no one does anything for nothing in politics and because there is always
                        a quid pro quo involved, Kaptaan had to do something he never imagined he would have to do in
                        order to create his cabinet.

                        When Imran Khan took over as Prime Minister of Pakistan, he had no idea what difficulties
                        awaited him at the Prime Minister's Office but as he assumed the Prime Minister ship, the
                        challenges began to unfold before him, painting a bleak picture. Consequence, the solemn
                        promises he made to the people of Pakistan during his election campaigns witnessed a massive
                        retrieval, and his political opponents and haters took advantage of the opportunity to
                        vehemently criticize his policies and brand him a leader of taking constant U-turns..</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Musk was born in Canada to a Canadian mother and a South African father. Musk
                        grew up with his head stuck in books and computers. He was bullied by his classmates and often
                        beaten up by class bullies as a little, timid youngster until he grew strong enough to defend
                        himself during a growth spurt in his teens. He developed a video game at the age of 12 and sold
                        it to a computer magazine. Musk left South Africa in 1988 after getting a Canadian passport
                        because he refused to support apartheid through compulsory military duty and wanted to pursue
                        the higher economic prospects offered in the United States..</p>

                        match against Karnataka. He scored 90 in that match. On that day only (19th December 2006), at 3
                        o’clock in the morning, his dad passed away due to brain stroke.

                        Virat played his first T 20 match against Himachal Pradesh at Delhi on the 3rd of April 2007. In
                        2008, he was the captain of the under 19 Indian Cricket team in the World Cup and India also won
